# Calculus Visualizer User Guide

## Introduction

Welcome to the Calculus Visualizer, an interactive tool designed to help you understand calculus concepts through intuitive 3D visualizations. This guide will help you navigate the application and get the most out of its features.

## Getting Started

### Accessing the Application

1. Open the Calculus Visualizer in your web browser
2. The application will load with a default visualization showing a basic function

### Understanding the Interface

The application is divided into several key areas:

- **Top Navigation**: Switch between calculus concepts and select your expertise level
- **Visualization Area**: The main 3D interactive display
- **Control Panel**: Function input and visualization controls
- **Examples Panel**: Pre-built examples demonstrating calculus concepts
- **Explanation Panel**: Educational content about the current concept

## Adjusting Your Experience Level

At the top of the screen, you'll find three experience levels:

- **Beginner**: Simplified controls and basic explanations
- **Expert**: More advanced controls and detailed mathematical explanations
- **Pro**: High-precision calculations and additional visualization options

Click on your preferred level to adjust the interface complexity.

## Core Features

### Exploring Different Calculus Concepts

Use the top navigation to switch between:

- **Derivatives**: Visualize rates of change and slopes
- **Integrals**: Explore areas under curves and accumulation
- **Limits**: Understand approaches to specific values

### Working with Custom Functions

1. In the Function Input card, enter your own mathematical function
   - Example: `x^2`, `sin(x)`, `e^x`, `x^3 - 2*x`
2. Click the "Update" button to visualize your function
3. Use the controls below to modify how the function is displayed

### Using the Visualization Controls

The visualization area includes several controls:

- **2D/3D Toggle**: Switch between 2D and 3D views
- **Animation Controls**: Start or stop animations
- **View Controls**: Reset view, zoom in/out
- **Color Theme**: Change the visualization color scheme

To navigate in 3D:
- **Rotate**: Click and drag
- **Pan**: Right-click and drag
- **Zoom**: Use the mouse wheel or zoom buttons

## Exploring Examples

### Car Acceleration Example

The car acceleration example demonstrates how calculus relates to vehicle motion:

1. Select "Car Acceleration" from the Examples dropdown
2. Observe the animated car moving along the position curve
3. Notice the three graphs representing:
   - Position function (blue): x(t) = tÂ² + 2t
   - Velocity function (red): v(t) = 2t + 2
   - Acceleration function (teal): a(t) = 2

4. Use the controls to:
   - Toggle the derivative graphs on/off
   - Show/hide the tangent line
   - Pause/play the animation
   - Reset the view

### Other Examples

Explore additional examples from physics and everyday life:

- **Spring Oscillation**: See how differential equations model spring movement
- **Wave Propagation**: Understand calculus in wave behavior
- **Population Growth**: Observe mathematical models of population changes
- **Market Equilibrium**: Explore optimization in economics

## Visualization Features

### Derivative Visualization

When exploring derivatives:

1. Enable "Show Derivative" to see the derivative curve
2. Toggle "Show Tangent Line" to display the tangent at a specific point
3. If showing the tangent line, use the slider to move the tangent point along the curve
4. Notice how the slope of the tangent line matches the value of the derivative

### Integral Visualization

When exploring integrals:

1. Use the sliders to set the lower and upper bounds
2. Observe the shaded area representing the definite integral
3. See the numerical value of the integral displayed
4. Toggle different approximation methods (rectangles, trapezoids)

### Limit Visualization

When exploring limits:

1. Use the slider to approach the limit point
2. Observe how the function values change as you approach
3. Toggle between one-sided and two-sided limits
4. See special cases like removable discontinuities

## Tips for Better Understanding

- Start with simple functions like `x^2` to understand basic concepts
- Use the animation features to see how values change over time
- Read the explanations in the right panel for mathematical context
- Try the real-world examples to connect calculus to practical applications
- Progress from Beginner to Expert level as you become more comfortable

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

- Ensure you're using a modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari)
- Check that JavaScript is enabled
- Try refreshing the page if visualizations don't load
- Reset the view if the visualization moves out of view
- Clear your browser cache if you experience persistent issues

Happy exploring!
