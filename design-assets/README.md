# Classical Design System for Calculus Visualizer

This directory contains design assets for implementing a classical design aesthetic for the Calculus Visualizer application. The design system draws inspiration from timeless principles of classical art and architecture to create a harmonious, elegant user interface that elevates the mathematical content.

## Directory Structure

- `/mockups` - SVG mockups for key layout elements
- `/implementation` - Implementation resources and preview pages

## Design Mockups

1. **Header with Classical Proportions** 
   - Balanced layout using golden ratio proportions
   - Classical typography and subtle ornamentation
   - File: `mockups/header-design.svg`

2. **Hero Section with Narrative Focus**
   - Composition guides users through content in a logical flow
   - Mathematical symbols integrated with classical aesthetic
   - File: `mockups/hero-design.svg`

3. **Feature Preview with Classical Visual Hierarchy**
   - Three balanced feature cards with classical proportions
   - Subtle ornamental details enhance without distracting
   - File: `mockups/feature-preview-design.svg`

4. **Customizable Section with Architectural Inspiration**
   - Layout inspired by classical architectural elements
   - Two-column design with golden ratio proportions
   - File: `mockups/customizable-section-design.svg`

## Implementation Resources

- **Design Implementation Guide** - Detailed recommendations for applying classical design principles to the application interface. File: `classical-design-implementation.md`
  
- **Design Preview Page** - HTML page showcasing all mockups with implementation notes. File: `implementation/design-previews.html`

## Classical Design Principles Applied

1. **Narrative and Storytelling**
   - Refined content flow and structured organization
   - Visual hierarchy that creates clear narrative progression
   - Typography that enhances readability and comprehension

2. **Visual Composition and Balance**
   - Golden ratio (1.618) proportions throughout the design system
   - Symmetrical layouts with balanced visual weight
   - Harmony between text and visual elements

3. **Color and Aesthetic Balance**
   - Color palette inspired by classical materials
   - Parchment, marble, stone, and azure tones
   - Subtle gold accents for refined elegance

4. **Integration of Form and Function**
   - Visual elements that enhance functional purpose
   - Clear hierarchy to guide interaction
   - Elegant simplicity that focuses attention on content

5. **Subtle Architectural Motifs**
   - Ornamental details inspired by classical architecture
   - Column patterns, decorative lines, and subtle textures
   - Classic proportions that create visual harmony
