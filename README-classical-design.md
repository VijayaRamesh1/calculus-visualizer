# Classical Design System for Calculus Visualizer

This update introduces a classical design system that enhances the visual aesthetics and user experience of the Calculus Visualizer application. The design system is inspired by timeless principles of classical art and architecture, creating a harmonious and elegant interface that elevates the mathematical content.

## Design Principles Applied

### 1. Narrative and Storytelling
- Refined content flow and section organization to guide users through a logical progression
- Enhanced typographic hierarchy to create a clear visual narrative
- Balanced visual elements to support the mathematical storytelling

### 2. Visual Composition and Balance
- Implemented classical proportions based on the golden ratio (1.618)
- Created visual harmony through symmetry and balanced layouts
- Used subtle visual cues to direct user attention

### 3. Color and Aesthetic Balance
- Developed a refined color palette inspired by classical materials:
  - Parchment, marble, stone, terracotta, and aged metals
  - Carefully selected accent colors for mathematical elements
  - Harmonious contrast for readability and visual comfort

### 4. Integration of Form and Function
- Designed all visual elements to support their functional purpose
- Enhanced visual hierarchy through classical proportions
- Maintained elegant simplicity that highlights mathematical content

### 5. Subtle Architectural Motifs
- Incorporated subtle classical-inspired details in UI elements
- Added refined decorative elements that enhance without distracting
- Used spacing and proportions based on classical architectural principles

## Implementation Details

### Files Added
- `assets/css/classical-design.css`: Core CSS design system
- `assets/js/classical-design.js`: Supporting JavaScript functionality

### Key Features
- **Classical Typography**: Using serif fonts (Cinzel, Lora) for elegant presentation
- **Golden Ratio Spacing**: Spacing system based on classical proportions
- **Refined Color Palette**: Colors inspired by classical materials and art
- **Subtle Animations**: Dignified transitions and reveals for content
- **Dark/Light Modes**: Classical themes for both light and dark preferences

## Usage
This design system is intended to be non-intrusive and compatible with the existing application architecture. It enhances the visual presentation while maintaining all functionality.

The classical design elements strengthen the connection between the mathematical content and its visual presentation, creating a cohesive and timeless experience that respects the elegance of calculus itself.
