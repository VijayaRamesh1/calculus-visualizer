# Calculus Visualizer

An interactive 3D visualization tool for calculus concepts using Three.js. This web application helps students and educators visualize and understand key calculus concepts including derivatives, integrals, and limits.

## Features

- Interactive 3D visualizations of mathematical functions
- Explore derivatives, integrals, and limits with real-time feedback
- Real-world examples from physics and everyday scenarios
- Adjust parameters to see how they affect visualizations
- Responsive design works on desktop and mobile devices

## Concepts Covered

### Derivatives

Visualize the rate of change of a function, including:
- Slope of tangent lines
- Relationships between a function and its derivative
- Critical points and extrema

### Integrals

Explore the area under curves and antiderivatives:
- Definite integrals as area under a curve
- Relationship between a function and its antiderivative
- Applications in physics and other fields

### Limits

Understand how functions behave as variables approach specific values:
- One-sided and two-sided limits
- Limits at points of discontinuity
- Limits at infinity

## Examples

The application includes several real-world examples:

- **Physics Examples:**
  - Projectile Motion: Visualize position, velocity, and acceleration
  - Spring Oscillation: Explore simple harmonic motion

- **Everyday Examples:**
  - Car Acceleration: See how calculus relates to everyday driving
  - Population Growth: Understand exponential models
